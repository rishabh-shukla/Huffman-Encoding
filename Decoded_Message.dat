GORAKHPUR: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi on Sunday urged the people help him break the negative image of the state and hinted at strong measures to ensure law and order. 
 "For the past few years Uttar Pradesh has been defined as a state from whose boundaries begins darkness, from where the pot-holed roads begin and the place from where the women start to feel insecure. I was to break this mindset," he said, and added that he wants to make UP a place, where women feel safe and secure. 
 Adityanath said, "I would like to assure that in the next two months, people would come to know how a state government should work. I have got an opportunity to clean-up the mess (kachdaa saaf karne kaa maukaa milaa hai), and I will do it." 
 The UP chief minister gave out a stern message to the anti-social elements and criminals in the state. 
 "There is no place for those who give patronage to the goonda elements, mafia, criminal and other rogue elements. They have the option of leaving UP or else they would land in places designated for them (jails)," he said, while hinting at massive revamping of law and order.
